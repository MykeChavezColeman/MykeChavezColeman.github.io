Final Project

I wanted to build a prototype of my company idea into a tangible final project. And as a result, choose a website to build.

The plan:
Build A website that had a landing page, an about section, a portfolio, and a team page.

Resources:
Webflow.com (provided a basic template that I was able to embed my code onto especially for the .css and js. portions

W3/geeksforgeeks/codeacademy: skeletons for HTML, CSS, JS

What Worked:
 Skeletons- these were a great way to build upon the knowledge I had and add the parts that I wanted in my code properly. I made sure to save the ones that I used and will have them to build upon in the foreseeable future.

Templates- initially I didn’t want to use one. The idea of creating the entire thing myself was the main goal and while I made my html myself, the beautification of my site was a bit over my head. That said, I still saw it as an opportunity to learn. Using a book for HTML and CSS, that included examples and sources I took those things and applied them to my project. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was doing with the template allowed me to see what I was doing in plain text.

What Didn’t Work:

I had a hell of a time adding my html to my GitHub Pages account. For some reason I just couldn’t embed it the same way I’ve done before. So, while the site is in git, it’s not online.

Lessons Learned:

I should have looked into for help than just the internet. Git is there, but there are also those who are good at Website building that I could have gleaned information.

WRITE AS I GO! I didn’t use git enough on this project. I didn’t make notes. I should have marked my errors instead of just wiping the slate clean.

More Git Stalking in the future.
